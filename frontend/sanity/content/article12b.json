While Vermont aims for value-based care, the market remains trapped in a Fee-For-Service war over unit prices. This analysis links the current MRI pricing dispute to the stagnation of the All-Payer Model and proposes Global Budgets as the theoretical mechanism to stop the cannibalization of the state's healthcare system.",

BCBSVT, acting as a rational market agent, is trying to strip away those profitable services. If BCBSVT wins, they save money on MRIs, but UVMMC's fixed-cost base collapses, forcing them to demand even higher rates on emergency services. It is a hydraulic system: squeeze one end, and the pressure explodes out the other."

This ruthlessly forces price convergence but risks bankrupting patients who require specific hospital-based imaging for clinical reasons."
