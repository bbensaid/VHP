  "summary": "The Vermont healthcare ecosystem has entered a phase of terminal economic instability. With residents spending 19.6% of their income on premiums to fund a system defined by 'allocative failure' and 262% price markups, this analysis argues that the Fee-For-Service model has rendered commercial cross-subsidization mathematically impossible.",

The recent public rupture between Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT) and the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) is not a standard contract dispute; it is a symptom of systemic 'Allocative Failure.' With residents spending 19.6% of their household income on insurance premiums—the highest rate in the United States and nearly double the national average—the market has ceased to function as a mechanism for value and has become a mechanism for extraction."

In Vermont, market power has distorted this principle beyond recognition."
