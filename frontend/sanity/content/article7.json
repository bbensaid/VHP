          "text": "In standard health economics, cost-shifting operates on a 'hydraulic' principle: as government reimbursement rates (Medicare/Medicaid) fall below the marginal cost of care, hospitals raise prices for private commercial insurers to cross-subsidize the loss. Bhattacharya notes that this model relies heavily on a firm's market power and a balanced payer mix. However, the Oliver Wyman report indicates a structural failure of this mechanism in Vermont. Due to demographic aging, the ratio of commercially insured patients in rural areas has plummeted. The remaining commercial base is too small to absorb the 'tax' required to cover the widening gap between Medicaid reimbursement and fixed hospital operating costs."

          "text": "Rural hospitals are characterized by high fixed costs relative to variable costs. The inability to cost-shift effectively leads to an immediate solvency crisis because revenue is largely fixed by government fee schedules, while inflation drives up input costs (labor, technology). Unlike standard competitive firms that would exit the market when Average Total Cost exceeds Price, rural hospitals are 'essential utilities' constrained by Act 167 mandates to remain open. This creates a disconnect between economic reality and policy mandate, forcing hospitals to consume reserves to survive."
