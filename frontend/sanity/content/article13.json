With residents paying 19.6% of their income on premiums and price disparities reaching 555% between academic and independent providers, this analysis breaks down the economic pathologies driving the crisis—from Physician-Induced Demand to the failure of cross-subsidization—and explores Global Budgets as a structural exit strategy.",

Data extracted from recent reports reveals a system where the 'price of admission' has become unsustainable: residents now spend 19.6% of their income on health insurance premiums—nearly double the national average of 7.9%. This financial strain is not an abstract market fluctuation; it is the direct result of a 'simmering and adversarial' relationship between a dominant insurer (BCBSVT) facing a $62.1 million deficit and a hospital network that holds significant market leverage."

In a perfectly competitive market, the price of a standardized commodity like an MRI would converge. However, Vermont's market is a 'Differentiated Oligopoly,' where the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC) commands two-thirds of total spending. Because the insurer cannot afford to lose the network's patients, UVMMC acts as a 'price maker' rather than a 'price taker.'"

The data shows that 31% of physician FTEs at UVMMC are non-clinical, yet clinical productivity remains low (75% of physicians are below the 50th percentile). In a Fee-For-Service (FFS) model, this bloat is incentivized. Physicians, acting as agents for uniformed patients, may recommend higher-intensity care that generates institutional revenue but offers diminishing marginal returns for patient health—a phenomenon known as the 'Flat of the Curve' medicine."

The proposed shift to 'Global Budgets' (modeled after Maryland) would cap total hospital revenue, flipping the incentive: suddenly, an MRI becomes a cost to manage rather than a product to sell. Furthermore, enforcing 'Site Neutrality' would mandate that a check-up costs the same whether performed in a hospital tower or a strip mall, effectively dismantling the arbitrage opportunity that drives today's 555% markups."
