This analysis quantifies the widening gap between labor supply and healthcare demand, exploring the inflationary impact of travel nursing dependence and the housing market’s role as a barrier to recruitment.",

The state is currently caught in a 'Demographic Pincer' movement. On one side, the demand for high-acuity care is accelerating as the population over 65 is projected to exceed 30% of the total state census by 2040. On the other side, the labor pool capable of delivering that care is evaporating." }]

This structural gap of 800 nurses annually creates a compounding deficit that disproportionately impacts rural facilities, which lack the brand equity and salary leverage of the UVM Health Network." }]

The selected video ([New Vermont programs aim to help cure nursing shortage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfxBt0lFp4w)) is directly relevant because it provides the visual evidence and specific numbers (1,200 needed vs 400 educated) referenced in the article's analysis of the supply-demand gap.
