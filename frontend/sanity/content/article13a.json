  "summary": "Vermont’s healthcare market has devolved into an open conflict between its largest insurer and largest hospital system, driven by a structural failure where residents pay 19.6% of their income on premiums. This analysis dissects the 'Adversarial Oligopoly' between BCBSVT and UVMMC, applies agency theory to the $6,520 MRI disparity, and argues why Global Budgets are the only theoretical exit from this zero-sum game.",

The latest escalation, a direct-to-consumer marketing campaign by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (BCBSVT) urging members to bypass the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC), is not merely a contract dispute. It is a signal that the market has reached a point of 'Allocative Failure.' With residents spending 19.6% of their household income on premiums—the highest rate in the nation and nearly triple the 7.9% national average—the system has crossed the threshold from expensive to predatory."

Recent disclosures reveal that UVMMC charges a premium of 262% to 555% over independent competitors for identical diagnostic work."

If a UVMMC specialist orders an MRI, they will default to the internal system. The patient, lacking medical knowledge, rarely overrides this 'default bias' even if it costs them thousands.\n\n2. **Moral Hazard & The Deductible:** For a patient who has already met their deductible, the marginal cost of a $6,500 MRI is zero. They have no financial incentive to drive to St. Albans for the $1,799 option. The cost is fully externalized to the insurance pool, driving up next year's premiums for everyone (the 'Tragedy of the Commons')."

The Wyman Report and economic consensus point to one viable exit strategy: **Global Budgets** (The Maryland Model).\n\nIn a Global Budget system, the state sets a total annual revenue cap for the hospital (e.g., $2 Billion). The hospital is paid this amount regardless of how many MRIs it performs. \n\n**Why this solves the problem:**\n* **Incentive Reversal:** Under FFS, every MRI is profit. Under Global Budgets, every MRI is a *cost*. UVMMC would suddenly *want* to send patients to the cheaper independent center to save its own budget.\n* **Stable Funding:** The 'Cost Shift' is formalized. The budget explicitly covers the Trauma Center's fixed costs, removing the need to overcharge for MRIs to keep the lights on.\n* **Site Neutrality:** It eliminates the arbitrage between hospital-based and freestanding clinics."
