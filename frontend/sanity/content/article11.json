"summary": "With 77.6% of U.S. physicians now employed by corporate entities, a counter-movement is rapidly gaining momentum. Burned out by the 'hamster wheel' of volume-based reimbursement, primary care doctors are opting out of the insurance system entirely to launch Direct Primary Care (DPC) and Concierge models, fundamentally disrupting the labor economics of health systems.",

The independent physician was declared an endangered species, with data showing a relentless march toward hospital employment. However, a quiet rebellion has begun at the edges of the primary care market. Driven by moral injury and the administrative burden of fee-for-service medicine, a growing cohort of doctors is executing a 'reverse merger'—firing their hospital employers to return to a direct-to-consumer relationship." }]

For primary care specifically, the corporate model's reliance on high-volume, 15-minute patient slots has proven fundamentally incompatible with the relational nature of the discipline." }]

Concierge medicine retains the insurance billing component but adds a substantial retainer (often $2,000+/year) for enhanced access, targeting a wealthier demographic." }]

This creates a paradox: the models that save the doctors may accelerate the access crisis for the system at large." }]

The video [Private Practice or Hospital Employed Physician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj4xkYtp4Fs) is relevant because it directly addresses the decision-making process for doctors considering leaving hospital employment, outlining the financial and lifestyle trade-offs discussed in the article.
